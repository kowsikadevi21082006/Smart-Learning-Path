# 📚 Smart Learning Path Generator (Python Track)

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Smart Learning Path Generator** is an AI-powered EdTech application that works like a **virtual academic counselor**.  
Instead of giving a fixed syllabus, it creates a **personalized, time-bound learning roadmap** based on a learner’s goals, current skills, and available time.

The aim is to help students **know what to study, when to study, and why it matters**.

---

## 🎯 What Problem It Solves
Most learners struggle with:
- Not knowing **where to start**
- Feeling overwhelmed by too many resources
- Wasting time on topics without clear purpose

This project solves that by generating **clear weekly plans with reasoning**, so learning feels structured and meaningful.

---

## 👤 How It Works (User Flow)
1. **User Input**
   - Current skills (example: basic Python)
   - Target goal (example: become a backend developer)
   - Time limit (example: 6 hours per week for 1 month)

2. **AI Roadmap Generation**
   - The AI creates a **week-by-week learning plan**
   - Each topic includes a short explanation of **why it is placed there**

3. **Visual Learning Path**
   - The roadmap is shown in a **timeline or Kanban board**
   - Users can click on each week to see details and study guidance

4. **Optional Quiz**
   - Users can generate a short quiz to test their understanding for that week
